**RELEASE NOTE v6.2.4**
-----------------------

The IoP Blockchain client version *6.2.4* is now available

Improvements
============
Cleared up the help message for dumpminerstats a bit
Preparations for more verbose minerstats
Optimized license cap calculation

Known Issues
============
Toolbar icons still render imperfectly
Scaling on Linux and Windows is still broken. To work around it, start the program with `QT_SCALE_FACTOR=2 iop-qt` or equivalently.
We received feedback about some possible UI improvements. Stay tuned!
